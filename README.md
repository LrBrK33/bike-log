# bike-log

An MVP project developed in React Native in 14 hours over 2 days.

## User Story

There are two kinds of mountain bikers. The first type finds settings that work OK and they use those settings all the time. The second type is constantly making small adjustments to tune and optimize the settings for every ride. John is the second type, and he wants a way to track his bike’s tunable settings on his phone. He wants to track the PSI, compression, and rebound settings for the front and rear suspension and his front and rear tire pressure for every ride. These logs will contain location information and he should be able to take additional notes with each saved setting. The application should communicate with Strava’s API to allow John to tag the rides where the settings were used, and those settings should appear in that ride’s description on Strava. He will be able to rate each setting, and these ratings will be used to provide a log of optimal settings.
